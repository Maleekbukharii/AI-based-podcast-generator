[00:00] Julia Matthews: Hey everyone! Welcome to "Mindful Moments." I’m Julia Matthews, and today we're gonna tackle something so many of us deal with—anxiety. We’re here to break it down and offer a bit of support. Joining me is the awesome Dr. Raj Patel, a psychologist who knows anxiety inside out. Hey, Dr. Patel!

[00:18] Dr. Raj Patel: Hi Julia! Thanks for having me. Anxiety is such a big topic, and I’m really excited to dive into it with you.

[00:25] Julia Matthews: And we’ve got Emily Torres with us too, sharing her personal journey with anxiety. Emily, thank you for being here.

[00:34] Emily Torres: Hi, Julia. I'm really glad to share my story and, hopefully, help someone else out there.

[00:40] Julia Matthews: Let’s jump right in, then! Dr. Patel, could you give us a quick rundown of what anxiety really is?

[00:50] Dr. Raj Patel: Sure thing. Anxiety is basically your brain's way of warning you about potential danger. It can actually be helpful, but when it sticks around too long or gets too intense, that’s when it starts interrupting your life.

[01:10] Julia Matthews: Got it. Emily, when did you first sense that it was more than just everyday stress?

[01:20] Emily Torres: Oh, that hit me hard in college. I was always on edge, couldn't focus, and started avoiding social stuff. It felt like I was in constant panic mode. That’s when I realized it wasn’t just regular stress.

[01:40] Dr. Raj Patel: Yeah, a lot of people first experience anxiety during big transitions like that. It's tricky but important to recognize when it’s becoming a problem.

[01:52] Julia Matthews: Definitely. Dr. Patel, what red flags should people look out for?

[02:00] Dr. Raj Patel: Well, you might notice constant worrying, restlessness, feeling tired, trouble concentrating, or having a hard time sleeping. Some people even feel their heart race or start sweating.

[02:20] Julia Matthews: Emily, does that sound familiar?

[02:24] Emily Torres: Oh, for sure. The physical stuff, like my heart racing, was a big wake-up call for me.

[02:33] Julia Matthews: Thanks for opening up about that. So, how did you start handling it?

[02:39] Emily Torres: Therapy was a game-changer. I learned mindfulness and did a lot of cognitive-behavioral work. Plus, meditation became my new best friend.

[02:55] Dr. Raj Patel: That’s awesome, Emily. Mindfulness really helps bring you back to the now, instead of worrying about what could happen later.

[03:08] Julia Matthews: I love it. Let’s talk more about those techniques. Dr. Patel, can you break down how CBT works?

[03:18] Dr. Raj Patel: Of course! CBT is about spotting and tackling negative thoughts and changing those patterns. It’s super effective for dealing with anxiety.

[03:35] Julia Matthews: Emily, any CBT techniques that you found super helpful?

[03:40] Emily Torres: Journaling was big for me. Writing down my thoughts helped me see the patterns and switch up the stories I was telling myself.

[03:55] Julia Matthews: That’s such a great tip. Any funny stories from your journey that stand out?

[04:05] Emily Torres: Oh, definitely! My therapist once suggested I name my anxiety. So, I called it "Nervous Nellie." It sounds silly, but it made my anxiety feel less scary.

[04:17] Julia Matthews: That's awesome! Naming it really can take away some of its power. Dr. Patel, what do you think about that approach?

[04:25] Dr. Raj Patel: I'm a big fan. Giving it a name can make anxiety feel more manageable—like it’s something separate from who you are.

[04:38] Julia Matthews: Love that advice. As we wrap up, Dr. Patel, what would you say to those listening who are struggling with anxiety?

[04:50] Dr. Raj Patel: First, you're definitely not alone, and help is out there. Learn about anxiety, see a professional if you can, and remember, be kind to yourself. Anxiety isn’t a personal failing.

[05:10] Emily Torres: Absolutely. Realizing it was okay to ask for help changed everything for me.

[05:18] Julia Matthews: Thank you both so much for your insights today. Emily, your courage is inspiring, and Dr. Patel, your guidance is invaluable.

[05:30] Dr. Raj Patel: Thank you, Julia. It’s been a pleasure.

[05:33] Emily Torres: Yes, thank you, Julia. This has been fantastic.

[05:36] Julia Matthews: And to our listeners, remember you're not alone. If you enjoyed today, subscribe and share with others who might need it. Until next time, be present and kind to yourself. Bye for now!
